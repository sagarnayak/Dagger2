dagger 2 example. this repo uses retrofit, picasso, dagger 2 to show an example for how to use the dagger 2 for DI in android.

Dagger 2 is a statically typed language. this means that the code we write is checked for error at compile time. also, dagger helps us inject a large set of dependency to a number of the class in an easy way. we just tell it where to inject, and what to inject. it also takes help of annotation processor to get the command from the user for injection scope and other params.
